# Tiny Flask Api

I created this to demonstrate something in work, and figured I'd put it on my GitHub so i didnt have to ever make another one.


### Environment Setup
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Start Flask API
```
./start.sh
```

### CURL The API

```bash
 curl -X GET <address-here>
```
